{
    // This is just a note for you since I couldn't talk to you.
    // I did some level design, I hope it's ok. You can change it if you wish.
    // I also organized a bit with the sprites into different folders.
    // I was thinking if we could do a fight scene in level 5 after the girl grabs the lamp in level 4.
    // Like once she grabs the lamp, she has to run from the monster that appears right next to her
    // then when she goes to level 5, she has to light the monster to kill them. maybe like 10 monster
    // or 5 it's up to you. After she finishes all the monsters, the fog clears where she escapes.
    // it's just a thought that came to me. it's ok if it's not good or to hard.
